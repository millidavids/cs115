this is a test file. 
this is to test the compression ability 
of program 4. 
I will include punctuation and capital letters. 
I will also include new lines. 
lol 
this line will be extremely long and will be used to test if the program will handle longer lines than would normally be seen in a normal text file. i will try to make this at least a couple of hundred characters long so as to test this correctly. i will also use different words as well as repeating words to make sure that the program accurately compresses the line into the appropriate unique words index 
now i will copy and paste this line many times to see how the program handles a lot of redundant words and line

this file is now starting to get bigger 
i want to try to append more text onto this file to make it longer 
i will just type out a stream of conscious 
i am enjoying python 
i look forward to working on my own projects with python in the future 
random punctuation (*&(*^)& )(&^^ (*& (*^&*%^&% &%$%^$ ^&%$&^ ^*(& 
i was having trouble with none ascii characters in files that i was copy pasting from the internet 
i hope that actually typing the text file out solves this problem 
i have also been pondering how one could go about compressing any type of file 
of course i could do research on it. But i would like to come up with a clever idea on how to do it before i look it up 
i am guessing the algorithm is similar to our program 4. The main difference being that you would search the machine 
code for similarities instead of ascii characters 
I will look this up later to find out. 
It seems to me that compression is heavily dependent on patterns. 
This file should be long enough now for a proper test.
