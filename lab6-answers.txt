When no seed is specified it uses the system time as the seed.2. When I ran the program with the same seed twice, I got the same two sets of numbers. This is because the algorithm is using the same number (185) and calculating the same “random” numbers.3. When moving the seed into the for loop, every single number in the 50 number for loop iteration was the same (14). This is because instead of using the seed for the whole set of numbers, the seed is being repeated for each iteration of the for loop.4. A constant seed does not give us truly random numbers. A constant seed give us the illusion of random numbers based on complex mathematical algorithms. A good use of constant seeds would be for testing programs when lots of “random” input is needed, but still needs to be repeatable.5. 0.494816597811488230.4996156625973270.499877413232189040.49998416588894446. The numbers are the mean of the set of random numbers. The float printed is approaching 0.5. It is that value because when taking the average of a set of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, the result should be 0.5 in a perfect world.
