# Define main.
    # Step 1: Import from the math library.
    # Step 2: Display Introductory Message with a line break.
    # Step 3: Prompt user for altitude of satellite and assign as a float: altitude = float(input())
    # Step 4: Assign constants (earth radius and gravitational mass of earth) to variables.
    # Step 5: Calculate the orbital radius of the satellite from equation: r = altitude + earth radius
    # Step 6: Convert orbital radius of satellite into meters from kilometers: kilometers * 1000
    # Step 7: Calculate velocity based on equation: v = math.sqrt(GM/R)
    # Step 8: Calculate the acceleration based on equation: a = GM/(R**2)
    # Step 9: Calculate the orbital completion time in seconds based on equation: p = math.sqrt((4(pi**2)R**3)/GM)
    # Step 10: Calculate the orbital completion time in minutes: p/60
    # Step 11: Round orbital time in minutes to the nearest 100th decimal.
    # Step 12: Print a line break.
    # Step 13: Print the output of orbital velocity in assigned format.
    # Step 14: Print the satellite acceleration in assigned format.
    # Step 15: Print the orbit time in seconds and minutes in assigned format.
# Call main.
