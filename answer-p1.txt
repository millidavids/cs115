Lab 4 math.sqrt



When using the sqrt function, the program ran exactly the same as when I used "**(1/2)".

When trying different values for math.sqrt, I got this output using the shell:

import math
math.sqrt(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <fragment>
builtins.ValueError: math domain error
math.sqrt(1)
1.0
math.sqrt(16)
4.0
math.sqrt(cheetos)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <fragment>
builtins.NameError: name 'cheetos' is not defined
math.sqrt(1.5)
1.224744871391589

The math.sqrt function seems to accept values just like "**(1/2)" would have. When trying to sqrt a negative number I got a domain error, just like you would encounter
if the math had been tried by hand. The sqrt accepts integers and floats, but not cheetos since cheetos is a string.
